## Data structure:
  1. Before using data, they have to be tidy : name of columns and raw should be strings and in each intersection between column/row, only one variable can be inserted ...
  2. In case data are not tidy, they could be by using **Tidyr** package in R language.
  
  
 ## Good practices:
  1. Taking notes and documenting. Tool: Computational notebooks and better, worflows
  2. Control software environnement. Tool: Containers and package managers. Best one: *Guix* 
  3. Data version control and archiving. Tool: *Github* or *Gitlab* but dont archive. Better ones: 
    - *arxiv.org* and *hal* for <ins>article archives</ins>
    - *figshare* and *zenodo* for <ins>data share</ins>
    - *software heritage* for <ins> software archive </ins>. 
    - *go-fair* platform. which is the most and usefull tool to store <ins> **ALL** </ins> data. It guarantees 4 principles: findable - Accessible - Interoperable - Reusable
