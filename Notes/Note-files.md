# Lecture 2 - 14/10/2021: 

- Checklist and hints for good graphics. [Slides](https://github.com/alegrand/SMPE/blob/master/sessions/2021_10_Grenoble/02_Check-list-good-graphics-tableau-en.pdf).
- Getting information from a data set: [Slides](https://github.com/alegrand/SMPE/blob/master/sessions/2021_10_Grenoble/02_Stat-desc1-en.pdf).
     - Vocabulary: Population, sub-population, variables and their types: quantitative and qualitative.
     - Statistical approaches:  
          1.  Defining the protocol to be followed for data collection.
          2.  Data collection, coding, cleaning.
          3.  Data exploration without trying to model them.
          4.  Data pre-processing.
          5.  If the data are from a sample, statistical modelling of the data.
          6.  Forecasting and/or decision making (answer to the initial question).
- **Activity**: Getting the wrong picture from the data 


# Lecture 3 - 21/10/2021:

- What is tidy data and why it must be used before any data processing ? [Slides](https://github.com/alegrand/SMPE/blob/master/sessions/2021_10_Grenoble/03_Tidy-data.pdf)
  - Tidy data = clean data.  They make the data analysis easier to model, to visualize and process. 
  - Any non-tidy data can be transformed to tidy-data. This process is called "Tidying". It may be performed using an available package in R called _dplyr_
- Open science: 
  - Sharing science and knowlegde is very important for ourselves and others.
  - Multiple tools exist to make this happen: Gitlab, Github and the more reliable one is Software Heritage
  - The most known reproducible research practices :
    1. Taking notes and documentations
    2. Controling software Environment. Tools: Containers and Package managers like GUIX
    3. Version controlling and archieving : FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable). Tools: Articles archives like HAL or ArXiv. Data archives like zenodo and Software Archive like Software Heritage
