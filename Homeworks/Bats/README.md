# TP on regression and analysis of variance.
The goal of this TP is to implement the estimation and classical tests presented in class for simple and multivariate regression models and analysis of variance. A final report has to be send to elise.arnaud@univgrenoble- alpes.fr within one week. The questions are here to guide you in your report. We are going to work on the file bats.csv which presents data from a study on the brain size of bats. The study is presented in [Hutcheon et al., 2002]. The abbreviations given in the file are described in the article like Diet categories (1 = phytophage; 2 = gleaner; 3 = aerial insectivore; 4 = vampire), BOW = body mass, BRW = brain mass, AUD = auditory nuclei volume, MOB = main olfactory bulb volume ; HIP = hippocampus volume.
